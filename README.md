# PY-CL-Modifying_Slicing_Lists

## Overview
This project demonstrates various list manipulation operations in Python. It includes functions to create lists, modify lists, and slice lists. The project also includes an interactive script (`app.py`) to demonstrate the functionality and a test script (`lab_test.py`) to verify the correctness of the implemented functions.

## Files

### app.py
The `app.py` file is the main entry point for the project. It allows users to interactively test the list manipulation functions implemented in `lab.py`. Users can create lists, modify lists, and slice lists through this script.

### lab.py
The `lab.py` file contains the implementations of various list manipulation functions. It includes functions to create lists, modify lists by appending, inserting, or removing elements, and slice lists to extract specific portions.

### lab_test.py
The `lab_test.py` file contains unit tests for the functions defined in `lab.py`. It verifies the correctness of the implemented functions by testing them with different input scenarios. The tests cover cases such as creating lists with valid and invalid inputs, modifying lists, and slicing lists.

## Project Structure
- src/
  - main/
    - app.py
    - lab.py
  - test/
    - lab_test.py

## Getting Started
1. Open the `app.py` file in the `src/main` directory.
2. Run the `app.py` file to interactively test the list manipulation functions.
3. Follow the prompts to create lists, modify lists, and slice lists.
4. Refer to the instructions provided in the docstrings of each function in `lab.py` for guidance on usage.

## Testing
1. Open the `lab_test.py` file in the `src/test` directory.
2. Run the `lab_test.py` file to execute the unit tests.
3. Ensure that all tests pass, indicating that the implemented functions are working correctly.

## Conclusion
This project provides practical examples of list manipulation in Python. By exploring the functions in `lab.py` and running the tests in `lab_test.py`, users can deepen their understanding of list operations and improve their Python programming skills.

Happy Coding!
